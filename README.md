# GuideKSA

An application that allows visitors to explore cities and areas using an interactive 
map. The app provides some of the city's most popular tourist attractions, 
including historical sites, museums, cultural centers, and outdoor spaces. It also 
provides events held by the Ministry of Entertainment. Users can navigate the 
city and discover new places before having to physically visit them.


#Developing a City Exploration App Using Scrum Methodology

We developed our city exploration app using Scrum methodology. We created a product backlog, divided it into sprints, and held sprint planning, review, 
and retrospective meetings. 
Our flexible development process allowed us to deliver value to our users, and we have now successfully finished building the app.
