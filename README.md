# GuideKSA
 Our approach was Creating a city exploration application using the Scrum methodology. We began by forming a product backlog, breaking it into sprints, and conducting sprint planning, review, and retrospective sessions. This agile development approach enabled us to bring value to our users, and we have successfully completed the app's construction. 

The app enables users to navigate and explore various aspects of a city, from its popular tourist spots like historical sites, museums, cultural centers, and outdoor spaces to events organized by the Ministry of Entertainment. It empowers visitors to virtually discover these locations before embarking on a physical visit, all through an interactive map.
